- 👋 Hi, I’m @dev-ziane
- 👀 I’m interested in Programming that makes mes happy, I have learned many languages (like C, C#, JAVASCRIPT,PHP.. ), but i found many problems with large projects that like project organisation how to minimize bugs to make the client happy and more, after that I asked my self what makes large companies (like Microsoft, gaming companies ..) publish applications with null buges? so I founded the answer after reading many blogs, books (TDD,DDD,SOLID,Concurrency in C# Cookbook..), and also tutorials.
- 🌱 I’m currently practicnig TDD, SOLID
- 💞️ I’m looking to developpe some of good applications, UI, and APIs using C#
- 📫 You can reach me in my email :
